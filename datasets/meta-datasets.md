# Datasets for Outlier Detection in Stream Data Experiments

You will find three folders:

- [synthetic] with datasets generated with MDCstream (in ARFF format).
- [real] with datasets download from different sources and preprocessed (in ARFF format).
- [srcs] with information about the downloaded datasets, their sources and conducted preprocessing. Check out the **"meta-???.md"** files for further information.
